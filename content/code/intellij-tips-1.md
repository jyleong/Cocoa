So at work I am deep into the Java environment, and our IDE of choice is IntelliJ. I used it before, but didn't work with it with other devs really. At Grow all the BE (Back End) Engineers are pretty skilled with Java and super comfortable with IntelliJ IDEA. I thought I would share some useful Mac OSX shortcuts and commands I use day to day.

##### Tips also apply to the JetBrains IDE suite: PyCharm, RubyMine, Webstorm, etc...
