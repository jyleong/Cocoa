#### More IntelliJ/IDEA tips I picked up from work:

* `CTRL + TAB` to switch between current open tabs in IntelliJ project
* `CMD + /` Block comment
* `CMD + L` Go to line, on your current file
* `CMD + SHIFT + F/R` find/replace `text` in the path or current project
* `CMD + F/CMD + R` find/replace a piece of text in current file
* `CTRL + SPACE` attempt to auto complete code (doesn't work 100% of time, but pretty decent)
* `CMD + SHIFT + A` does a search for list of available commands in IntelliJ. When you find the command, it will show you the keyboard shortcut to perform it
