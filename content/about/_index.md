Hello, welcome to my site. 
I'm an experienced Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [SFU](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html)

Besides being a code monkey, I am an adventurous, athletic, goal oriented individual, that applies 110% of my effort to anything that I see important.

### Interests and Hobbies
* Hacking
* Weight training
* Running
* Cooking and Baking
* Reading
* Anime and Manga
* Deep conversations with others
* Anything Science, technology, CS, Engineering related...

I intend to pursue a Master's in Computer Science, after working for a bit as well :D

### Research interests
* Machine Learning
* Distributed Computing
* Quantum Computing
* Natural language Processing
* Computational Theory
* Bioinformatics
* Data Science

I equate ones worth to the value they can bring to society to start with that, you need to know how to perservere and build real life skills. This is a philosophy I live by:

>Life has no meaning, so make meaning for yourself

This comes from something I have associated to true failure. From there I realized that most learning and things, I have to do on my own. I figured I had to put in the extra effort to get out of the place that I was in.

This experiences shows my true character, my work ethic and motivation to succeed. It's hard to get out of rock bottom. 

From my failure it gave me the motivation and inspiration to strive onward and be the Software Engineer I am today. I hope I could be an example of not being the best coder or engineer, but an example of what you can be if you do your best.
