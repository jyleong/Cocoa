__f you came here to verify my work experience here is my [Resume/CV]({{< ref "resume.md" >}})__

This space on the internet is owned by James. Hi there, the intent of the blog is to track my personal progress through each important dimension of my life: **Health, Friends/Familial Relationships, Career, Hobbies, Habits, Meaning and fulfillment.**

he goal is as I track and hopefully progress in my life based on principles of self-discipline, stoicism and minimalism is to inspire readers of my blog to apply the methods/experiments that have work on myself towards improving their lives.

This is also an outlet that acts as my accountability coach, __that is you__ -- my readers.

This is meant to improve on many aspects of my life, I believe I am capable of this because I've done it before to be relative successful with building my primary skillset for my professional career.

Besides being a code monkey, I am an adventurous, athletic, goal oriented individual, that actively puts in his best effort into what I deem important and valuable.

More on that point, I figured that I should be putting my best foot forward into everything that I do because that is a reflection of myself.

Really I started delving into my personal goals after I came across Dr. Jordan Peterson, he is now my most admired person. Just the way he articulates his thoughts and his messages he conveys in his lectures speaks to the nihilism we have in our society today. He was so influential to me, I took his online tools UnderstandMyself, Past, Present and Future Authoring. That was when I stated out my goals and broadly set a path to achieve them. </p>

You can say that I have always had this inkling of how to pursue my life. Only after finding him that he put these thoughts that __I have always had__ into tangible words with an explanation to why we all have these thoughts, feelings and goals.

Beginning of this year 2019 was when I put most effort in these broad goals in core tenants of my life. That was a good starting point. At the same time it was still more free-flowing and up to my interpretation. My hopes with tracking everything down here is to hone and focus the goals. An online log as a source of truth could also bring to surface some things I would not have noticed if I didn't keep track at all.

These are my intentions of starting a self-improvement blog with an emphasis on philosophy, finding meaning and minimalism.

Now that you get a sense that I am hyper conscientious I should tell you more about myself.... I genuinely enjoy exposing myself to new experiences. Throughout my current experiences I have develop the love of learning. In fact, most of the hobbies that I do and enjoy are fairly productive I would say. Aside from some occasional Youtube, Music consuming and slight procrastination after tough work.

### These are the things I am interested in and am currently doing:

* Hacking
* Weight training
* Nutrition
* Martial Arts
* Self-Improvement
* Anime and Manga
* Meditations
* Stoic Philosophies and practices
* Journalling
* Deep conversations with others
* Investing (FI/RE club where at?)
* Learning about topics outside of my discipline (politics, psychology, economics...)
* Anything Science, technology, CS, Engineering related...

Generally exposing myself to new and varied experiences.

I equate ones worth to the value they can bring to society to start with that, you need to know how to perservere and build real life skills. This is a philosophy I live by:

Many of these things I see a steady and incremental progression as I keep working at each of them.
I want to build all these skills/tangible things and integrate them into myself because I equate ones worth to the value they can bring to society. To start with that, you need to know how to persevere and build real life skills. This is a philosophy I live by:

>Life has no meaning, so make meaning for yourself

his comes from chapters in my life that I have experienced true failure. Finally overcoming those terrible experiences taught me a valuable lesson: For anything that I want to gain, achieve, learn, do in life - I have to do on my own. I figured I had to put in the extra effort to get out of the place that I was in.

This experience shows my true character, my work ethic and motivation to succeed.

..It was hard to get out of rock bottom.

From my failure it gave me the motivation and inspiration to strive onward and be at I am today. I hope I could be an example of not being the best engineer/most good looking/strongest guy/manly man/richest person or whatever else, but an **example of what you can be if you do your best.**
