Hello, welcome to my site. 
I'm an experienced Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [SFU](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html)

Besides being a code monkey, I am an adventurous, athletic, goal oriented individual, who applies 110% of my effort to anything that I see important.

### Interests and Hobbies
* Hacking
* Weight training
* Nutrition
* Martial Arts
* Self-Improvement
* Anime and Manga
* Deep conversations with others
* Learning about topics outside of my discipline (politics, psychology, economics...)
* Anything Science, technology, CS, Engineering related...

Generally exposing myself to new and varied experiences
Besides having a multitide of interests, to hone in on them I must pick and prioritize 
what I believe is most important:

### What I'm currently doing right now:
* Taking personal responsibility for myself, including my nutrition, mental health and goals
* Taking care of my finances, saving for my first car and down payment
* Building closer personal relationships with my friends and family. I would do this by setting frequent and consistent times with the people who I want to hang out with.
* Improving on my social, communication skills, I want to be more approachable, carry a conversation well, and be at a point where anyone can be open to talk to me about anything
* Martial arts, I do kickboxing and Tae Kwon Do. After a long hiatus I want to pick them back up, with the goal of getting my black belt in Tae Kwon Do. I attend and practice this daily.
* Learning Mandarin, I'm the standard CBC, my mother tongue sucks. It's important to know this, especially since I want to travel frequently. I want to be able to read, write, speak in mandarin. Ideas for working at this would be to watch many chinese dramas, understand common words. Write down phrases I don't understand and look them up later.
* Software Engineering! We should always try to hone our skills. I intend to dive deep into the core, foundation, fundamentals of design pattern books: DDD, EIP. With those ideas in mind work on a personal project with technologies of my choice, most likely ReactJS + Redux Frontend on a Java Backend (maybe Play Framework)

These are my big goals. Clearly defining these large goals I can focus on them while still having time to take care of myself. I will know my limits therefore restrict myself from taking on other activities, saying no to what people would say are 'good' opportunities.
<br />

I equate ones worth to the value they can bring to society to start with that, you need to know how to perservere and build real life skills. This is a philosophy I live by:

>Life has no meaning, so make meaning for yourself

This comes from something I have associated to true failure. From there I realized that most learning and things, I have to do on my own. I figured I had to put in the extra effort to get out of the place that I was in.

This experiences shows my true character, my work ethic and motivation to succeed. It's hard to get out of rock bottom. 

From my failure it gave me the motivation and inspiration to strive onward and be the Software Engineer I am today. I hope I could be an example of not being the best coder or engineer, but an example of what you can be if you do your best.
